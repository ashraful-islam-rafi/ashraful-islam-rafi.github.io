  Hi, my name's Rafi. I am a second-year computer science PhD student at [UAB](https://www.uab.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, specializing in functional compilation and functional program analysis under the supervision of [Dr. Thomas Gilray](https://thomas.gilray.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in the HARP lab.

    <br/>
    Prior to that, I worked as a Software Engineer (R&D) at [Bangla Search Engine (Pipilika)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipilika){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for almost 4 years. Before that, I was working in the software industry for more than 3 years taking on roles such as Programmer, Senior Software Engineer, and Software Developer. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Leading University, Bangladesh](https://www.lus.ac.bd){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, in 2013.

          - **Search Engine Improvement:** Conducting extensive research using ML techniques such as Deep Learning to solve Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems for the Bengali Language.

          - **Search Relevancy Improvement:** Improved keyword-based search relevancy by designing dynamic schema in Apache Solr supported by the calculative implementation of Solr’s dismax query parser and query boosting.
 
          - **A2i Search Portal:** Spend around six months to discover a generic approach to Crawl, Parse, and Index the unstructured data from over 40,000 websites and later on wrote REST API using Spring Boot.
 
          - **Spellchecker Context-Aware Library:** After month-long, thorough research into the project improved the file—Dictionary—loading time by 20 seconds.
 
          - **Solr Analytic Library:** The development of this plug and play library required a lot of individual research which can provide domain wise time series data for any project build upon Apache Solr.
 
          - **Rich Document Parser Library:** Wrote generic parser using jsoup library to extract data from file types such as DOC, PDF, PPT, CSV, etc. Extracting Bangla Unicode data from PDF files was the biggest challenge of all.
